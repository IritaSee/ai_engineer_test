# Artificial Intelligence Engineer Employee Test

## Main purpose
This repository is the answer from me (Iga Narendra) for question Q4 and Q5 in the employee test. Q4 is about text processing and Q5 is a simple face recognition system.
## How to use
All external library I used in these answers are available in `requirements.txt`. Open your terminal, change the working directory to this directory, then install required libraries all at once by typing:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
in your terminal. Or, simply open `Q4_Text_Processing.ipynb` for answers in question Q4 and run the first cell. They do exacly the same. Answer Q5 has its own directions of use inside the `./Q5` folder in this repository.
